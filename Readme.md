# Wildfire Simulation with Drone Swarm Monitoring System

An agent-based model for wildfire simulation integrated with autonomous drone swarm monitoring capabilities.

## Overview

This project simulates wildfire progression using computational models while deploying a virtual drone swarm for real-time monitoring and data collection. The system utilizes the Mesa framework for agent-based modeling with Solara visualization.

## Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Cell agents for fire simulation and drone agents for monitoring
- **Realistic Fire Spread**: Based on the Rothermel model
- **Environmental Factors**: Wind, terrain, and vegetation influence
- **Drone Swarm Intelligence**: Coordinated autonomous monitoring
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time simulation data through Solara UI

## Installation

### Method 1: Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildfire-simulation.git
cd wildfire-simulation

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
